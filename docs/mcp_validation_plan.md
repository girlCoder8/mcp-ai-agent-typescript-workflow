# MCP Validation Plan

This document outlines the test strategy for validating the AI-powered Modular Control Plane (MCP) within the automation framework.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure MCP accurately orchestrates test agents.
- Validate integration across API, mobile, and data layers.
- Maintain observability, test traceability, and AI output validity.

---

## 🔍 Scope
- Multi-agent orchestration for API and mobile scenarios
- AI-driven test generation accuracy
- Agent scheduling, lifecycle, and messaging integrity
- Compliance with security, performance, and logging requirements

---

## 🧪 Test Types

### ✅ Unit Tests
- Validate config schema loading and validation
- Check plugin hooks and adapters individually

### 🔗 Integration Tests
- Connect MCP to Postman, Headspin, Appium, and Playwright test runners
- Verify communication with OpenAI and Zephyr APIs

### 🔄 Regression Tests
- Re-run known passing scenarios across agents
- Simulate rollback and recovery from failure states

### 🧠 AI Validation
- Compare AI-generated tests vs. expected/manual scripts
- Sanitize prompt and response logs for sensitive data
- Score test utility (pass/fail frequency, runtime coverage)

## 📊 Metrics

| Metric                       | Target            |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Agent Initialization Time   | < 3 sec           |
| AI Test Pass Rate           | > 90%             |
| Execution Time Variance     | < 15% fluctuation |
| Test Flake Rate             | < 5%              |

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
- All AI interactions redacted
- Isolated execution environments for agents
- No test logs stored in public LLMs

---

## 📅 Schedule
- Sprint 1: Local & CI orchestration validation
- Sprint 2: API and Mobile Agent Sync Tests
- Sprint 3: AI Integration, Fault Injection
