# Strategies to Ensure Data Compatibility and Security During Automation Processes

## ‚úÖ Data Compatibility
- **Standardized Data Models**: Define schemas (e.g., JSON Schema, OpenAPI) to validate inputs and outputs.
- **Version Control**: Use semantic versioning for APIs and test data contracts.
- **Data Transformation Layers**: Implement adapters or converters for legacy vs. modern data formats.
- **Schema Validation**: Run pre-test checks with libraries like `Ajv` (JSON), `Cerberus` (Python), or `Joi` (Node.js).

## üîê Data Security
- **Environment Segregation**: Run sensitive tests in isolated or sandboxed environments.
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure vaults (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) instead of storing secrets in code or `.env`.
- **Encrypted Communications**: All test-related communications (between services, agents, CI/CD) should be over HTTPS or via secure message queues.
- **Access Controls**: Limit data exposure through RBAC in test systems, pipelines, and dashboards.
- **Audit Trails**: Log access to test data and artifacts for traceability and compliance.
