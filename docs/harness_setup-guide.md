# Harness AI Test Automation Pipeline Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you integrate your comprehensive AI Test Automation project structure into Harness CI/CD instead of GitHub Actions. The pipeline leverages multiple AI agents for chaos engineering, root cause analysis, code review, test generation, synthetic data creation, and analytics validation.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Harness Platform Setup
- Harness CI/CD account with appropriate licenses
- Project created in Harness with identifier: `ai_testing_project`
- Organization identifier: `default` (or update accordingly)

### 2. Required Integrations
- GitHub/GitLab repository access
- Docker Hub or private container registry
- Cloud provider accounts (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Kubernetes cluster for AI agent deployment
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
- JIRA for issue tracking
- Slack for notifications

### 3. AI Model Access
- OpenAI API key for GPT models
- Anthropic API key for Claude models
- Sufficient API quota for your testing volume

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Secrets in Harness

Navigate to Account/Org/Project Settings > Secrets and create the following secrets:

#### AI Model APIs
```bash
# Account-level secrets (recommended)
openai_api_key: your-openai-api-key
anthropic_api_key: your-anthropic-api-key
```

#### Cloud Provider Credentials
```bash
aws_access_key: your-aws-access-key
aws_secret_key: your-aws-secret-key
azure_secret: your-azure-service-principal-secret
gcp_service_account_key: your-gcp-service-account.json
```

#### Infrastructure & Tools
```bash
k8s_config: your-kubernetes-config-file
docker_password: your-docker-hub-password
github_token: your-github-personal-access-token
jira_token: your-jira-api-token
teams_webhook_url: your-teams-webhook-url
```

### Step 2: Create Connectors

Use the connectors configuration file to set up:
1. GitHub connector for source code
2. Docker Hub connector for container images
3. Cloud provider connectors (AWS/Azure/GCP)
4. Kubernetes cluster connector
5. Monitoring connectors (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
6. Tool connectors (SonarQube, JIRA, Teams)

### Step 3: Create Services and Environments

1. **Service**: AI Test Automation Service
    - Type: Kubernetes
    - Artifacts: Docker images for AI agents
    - Manifests: Kubernetes YAML files

2. **Environments**:
    - Development (chaos disabled, basic monitoring)
    - Staging (chaos enabled, enhanced monitoring)
    - Production (full chaos testing, comprehensive monitoring)

### Step 4: Deploy the Pipeline

1. Import the main pipeline YAML file
2. Configure input sets for different environments
3. Set up triggers for automated execution
4. Configure approval workflows for production deployments

### Step 5: Configure Monitoring and SLOs

1. Set up monitored services
2. Configure SLOs for:
    - AI model response time (<2s)
    - Test execution success rate (>95%)
    - Chaos recovery time
3. Set up alerts and notifications

## Pipeline Stages Explained

## Advanced Features

### 1. Dynamic Pipeline Variables
- `AI_MODEL_VERSION`: Choose between GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, or Claude
- `CHAOS_INTENSITY`: Control chaos engineering intensity (low/medium/high)
- `SYNTHETIC_DATA_SIZE`: Configure synthetic data generation volume
- `PARALLEL_EXECUTION`: Enable/disable parallel test execution

### 2. Conditional Execution
- Chaos engineering can be disabled in development
- Infrastructure deployment only on main branch
- Different AI model budgets per environment

### 3. Approval Workflows
- Chaos engineering requires approval from reliability team
- Production deployments require multiple approvals
- AI model usage limits enforced via policies

### 4. Integration Points
- **JIRA**: Automatic ticket creation for failures
- **Slack**: Real-time notifications and alerts
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability with SLOs
- **Security**: Integrated security scanning and compliance

## Best Practices

### 1. AI Model Management
- Use environment-specific model configurations
- Implement token usage tracking and limits
- Cache AI responses where appropriate
- Monitor model performance and drift

### 2. Security Considerations
- Store all secrets in Harness Secret Manager
- Use least-privilege access for service accounts
- Implement GDPR compliance for synthetic data
- Regular security scanning of AI-generated code

### 3. Cost Optimization
- Set AI API usage limits per environment
- Use smaller models for development/staging
- Implement intelligent caching for AI responses
- Monitor and optimize resource usage

### 4. Reliability & Monitoring
- Set up comprehensive SLOs
- Implement circuit breakers for AI services
- Monitor AI agent performance
- Set up alerting for failures and anomalies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI API Rate Limits**
    - Solution: Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
    - Configure different rate limits per environment

2. **Kubernetes Deployment Failures**
    - Solution: Verify RBAC permissions and resource quotas
    - Check cluster connectivity and node resources

3. **Test Flakiness**
    - Solution: Use AI-powered flaky test detection
    - Implement test result analysis and automatic retries

4. **High AI API Costs**
    - Solution: Optimize prompts and implement caching
    - Use different models for different stages

### Monitoring and Alerts

Set up alerts for:
- AI model response time > 5 seconds
- Test success rate < 90%
- Chaos recovery time > 60 seconds
- AI API errors > 5% of requests
- Resource utilization > 80%

## Migration from GitHub Actions

### Key Differences

1. **Workflow Syntax**: Harness uses YAML with different structure
2. **Secrets Management**: Harness has centralized secret management
3. **Parallel Execution**: Harness provides native parallel step execution
4. **Approval Gates**: Built-in approval workflows in Harness
5. **Monitoring**: Integrated SLO and monitoring capabilities

### Migration Checklist
